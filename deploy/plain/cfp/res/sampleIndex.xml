         xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="sampleIndex.xsd">
  <sample name="sArc" title="Arc">
    This is a simple demonstration of the use of <i>Cairo</i>'s
    <tt>CairoContext::arc()</tt> method, drawing a black <tt>135</tt> degree
    arc.
    <br /><br />
    <small>See also: Arc Negative</small>
  </sample>
  <sample name="sArcNegative" title="Arc Negative">
    This is a simple demonstration of the use of <i>Cairo</i>'s
    <tt>CairoContext::arcNegative()</tt> method, drawing a black <tt>225</tt>
    degree arc by defining a <tt>135</tt> arc but drawing with the
    <tt>arcNegative</tt> method instead of the <tt>arc</tt> method.
    <br /><br />

  </sample>
  <sample name="sClip" title="Clip">
    Shown here is the effect of clipping on the surface, as both the cross and
    the black background actually span over the size of the whole canvas but
    only the area masked by the <tt>arc</tt> and then clipped using
    <tt>CairoContext::clip()</tt> is shown.
    <br /><br />
    <small>See also: Clip Image</small>
  </sample>
  <sample name="sClipImage" title="Clip Image">
    Shown here is the effect of clipping on an <tt>ImageSurface</tt>, as the
    circle is clipped out it is the only area left visible, the surrounding
    gray area is in fact transparent.
    <br /><br />
    <small>See also: Clip</small>
  </sample>
  <sample name="sCurveRectangle" title="Curve Rectangle">
    This demonstrates how a curved rectangle could be realized if desired. The
    code shown is potentially capable of being packed into a
    <tt>php function</tt>.
  </sample>
  <sample name="sCurveTo" title="Curve To">
    This sample illustrates how <i>Cairo's</i> <tt>Cairo::curveTo()</tt>
    function depends on its three parameters, with the red lines illustrating
    the start and end direction of the path respectively, passing the control
    point in the middle to draw a <i>cubic BÃ©zier curve</i>.
  </sample>
  <sample name="sDash" title="Dash">
    A simple demonstration of how a dashed line can be drawn using a (skip, ink,
    skip, ink, ...) pattern.
